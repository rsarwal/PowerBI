## Key Analytical Insights  

### **1. Consumer Demographics by Race/Ethnicity**  
- **Insight**: White consumers form the largest group, followed by Hispanic/Latino consumers. African American and Asian demographics follow as significant contributors. Smaller yet notable groups include American Indian and Pacific Islander consumers.  
- **Implications**: Programs could prioritize culturally tailored services for larger demographic groups while ensuring inclusivity for smaller populations to maintain equity.  

### **2. Yearly Trends in Consumer Numbers (2014–2022)**  
- **Insight**:  
  - Consumer numbers peaked in **2020**, reaching **101K**, possibly due to expanded program efforts or economic factors.  
  - A decline occurred in subsequent years, with consumer numbers falling to **89K in 2022**, reflecting external disruptions such as the pandemic's impact on service access or program capacity.  
- **Implications**: Tracking these trends allows organizations to forecast demand and identify periods requiring additional outreach or resources.  

### **3. Top 10 Counties by Consumer Numbers**  
- **Insight**:  
  - **Los Angeles County** leads with **64K consumers**, followed by **San Diego (52K)**, and **Orange County (42K)**.  
  - Rural and less densely populated counties show significantly lower consumer numbers, highlighting geographic disparities in access or outreach.  
- **Implications**: Higher-consumer regions may require greater funding and resources, while rural areas could benefit from targeted outreach programs to bridge service gaps.  

### **4. Distribution of Consumers by Race/Ethnicity Across Counties**
